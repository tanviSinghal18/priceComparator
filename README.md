Price Comparator for e commerce websites
 The objective of this project is to facilitate the comparison of product prices between two distinct websites. The project
will allow users to input the desired product they are searching for, and subsequently provide information on its availability
on a specific website. If the product is found on the website, it will further furnish the corresponding price details, enabling
users to compare prices between the two designated online shopping platforms, namely Amazon and Flipkart, which are
considered prominent in the industry.
